## Why it is here

BSPK is **deprecated**. Following the merger of Anywhere Real Estate and Compass, it is no longer maintained, and its repositories and `@bspk/*` npm packages are not being updated.

This project keeps the work usable on its own terms. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Anywhere Real Estate or Compass.

## What changed

- **Consolidated.** The separate repositories are now one npm workspace.
- **Renamed.** BSPK is now pttrn, and the packages are published as `@ptrn/*`.
- **One theme.** The nine real estate brand themes are removed. The remaining theme, formerly `anywhere`, is now `nowhere`, along with its icon set and `StylesProviderNowhere`.
- **Country icons removed.** The `country` icon set (flags and currency symbols) was dropped. `InputPhone` shows no flags unless the consumer passes `renderFlag`.
- **Third-party logos removed.** The `brand` icon set (payment networks, social platforms, app stores) was dropped.
- **De-branded.** Organization URLs, internal domains, issue trackers and contact addresses are removed.

## Provenance of the assets

- The `material` icon set is derived from [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons), published by Google under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- The `nowhere` icon set, the component library, and the design tokens originate from BSPK.
- The `Flag` component embeds the flag sprite from [world-flags-sprite](https://github.com/lafeber/world-flags-sprite), Copyright (c) 2012 Martijn Lafeber, 2018 Francescu Garoby, released under the MIT License.
